# prt4cmd - CityEngine SDK Command Line Utility

## Disclaimer

This is an example for using the CityEngine SDK. There is no support for this application. If you find a bug or want to enhance functionality you have to fix/do this yourself.

## Prerequisites

Before you start working with this example, please make sure you follow the main installation instructions for the CityEngine SDK in the README.md file at the root of this example repository. This will  explain how to get the sdk binaries and example data.

## Software Requirements

* See "General Software Requirements" (Windows)

## Build Instructions

1. Open a `VS2022 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt`
1. Change into the example directory: `cd <your path to>\cityengine-sdk\examples\prt4cmd`
1. Prepare build directory: `mkdir build`
1. And change into it: `cd build`
1. Run cmake: `cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..\src`
1. Compile: `nmake install`
1. The build result will appear in an `install` directory in parallal to the `build` directory.

## Using prt4cmd

1. Open a cmd shell and `cd` into the above `install` directory.
1. Type `bin\prt4cmd.exe -h` to see the list of options.
1. Type the following to generate the "candler" building model in the wavefront obj format:

   ```text
   bin\prt4cmd.exe -l 3 -g ..\..\..\data\candler_footprint.obj -p ..\..\..\data\candler.rpk -e com.esri.prt.codecs.OBJEncoder -z baseName:string=theCandler
   ```

1. The result is placed in a new `output` directory inside the `install` directory:
    * `theCandler_0.obj`
    * `theCandler.mtl`
    * Bunch of texture files
1. To regenerate the same model with a different height, use the following command (note the additional `-a BuildingHeight...` statement):

   ```text
   bin\prt4cmd.exe -l 3 -g ..\..\..\data\candler_footprint.obj -p ..\..\..\data\candler.rpk -a BuildingHeight:float=30 -e com.esri.prt.codecs.OBJEncoder -z baseName:string=theCandler
   ```

1. The obj file will now contain a model which is 30m high instead of the default 62m.
