# Esri CityEngine SDK Examples

The Esri CityEngine is based on the procedural runtime, which is the underlying engine that supports two geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS and drives procedural symbology in ArcGIS Pro. The CityEngine SDK enables you as a 3rd party developer to extend CityEngine with additional import and export formats. Moreover, you can integrate the procedural runtime in your own client applications taking full advantage of the procedural core without running CityEngine or ArcGIS.

## Preamble

This document explains how to install the CityEngine SDK and how to work with the source-code examples contained in this repository. The Esri CityEngine SDK is packaged into three parts:
- This git repository with the example sources.
- An archive with the SDK binaries and documentation (whitepaper and API reference).
- An archive with example data (e.g. rule packages and initial shapes).

The archives are available for download at the corresponding github release page. See installation instructions below for details.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Download the SDK binary archive from the release page
3. Download the SDK example data archive from the release page
4. Unzip the archives into the cloned repository into a "prt" and "data" directory.

The final directory layout should look like this:
```
/esri-cityengine-sdk/
    examples/...
    license/...
    data/...
    prt/
        bin/...
        cmake/...
        doc/...
        include/...
        lib/...
```

## Examples
This repository contains a number of source code examples. Each example contains a README with detailed instructions how to build and use it.

A quick overview:
- prt4cmd: a simple command line utility to apply rule packages onto initial shapes and generate models.
- prt4maya: wraps the SDK into a plugin for Autodesk Maya
- stlenc: demonstrates how to write a custom encoder, in this case for the STL geometry format.

## General Software Requirements
Please note that the individual example READMEs may include further requirements.

#### All Platforms
* To load custom encoders built with this SDK in CityEngine, CityEngine 2016.0 is required. For older versions of CityEngine an older version of the SDK might have to be used, see table above. 
* License for matching CityEngine
* CMake 3.0.0 or later (http://www.cmake.org)

#### Windows
* Windows 7 or later (64bit)
* NMake 10.0 or later (NMake is part of Visual Studio)
* Recommended C++ Compilers for client code (e.g. `prt4cmd` example): `VC 12 C++ Compiler (Visual Studio 2013) or later`
* To compile SDK extensions (e.g. the `stlenc` example or a custom encoder) it is required to use this exact compiler:
    * Microsoft `VC12 C++ Compiler (cl.exe) 18.00.40629.0`, included in `Visual Studio 2013 Update 5`
    * Required flags: `/bigobj /GR /EHsc /MD`

#### MacOSX
* GNU Make 3.82 or later
* Recommended build environment for client code (e.g. the `prt4cmd` example):
    * MacOSX Yosemite (10.10) or later
    * Apple CLANG 6.1 or later
* **Required** build environment to compile SDK extensions (e.g. the `stlenc` example for use in CityEngine and other custom extensions):
    * MacOSX Yosemite (10.10)
    * Apple CLANG 6.1 included in XCode 6.4
    * Required flags: `-std=c++14 -stdlib=libc++ -fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden -Wl,--exclude-libs,ALL`

#### Linux
* RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.x or compatible (64bit only)
* GNU Make 3.82 or later
* Recommended C++ Compilers for client code (e.g. the `prt4cmd` example):
    * GCC 4.8.2 or later
* To compile SDK extensions (e.g. the `stlenc` example for use in CityEngine or other custom extensions) it is required to use this **exact** C++ build environment:
    * GCC 4.8.2 included in RedHat Enterprise Linux 6 DevToolSet 2.1
    * Required flags `-std=c++11 -march=nocona -fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden -Wl,--exclude-libs,ALL`
