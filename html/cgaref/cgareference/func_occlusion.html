<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p class="code2">bool inside()</p>
<p class="code2">bool overlaps()</p>
<p class="code2">bool touches()</p>
<br>
<p class="code2">bool inside(<span class="cga_opparam">target-selector</span>)</p>
<p class="code2">bool overlaps(<span class="cga_opparam">target-selector</span>)</p>
<p class="code2">bool touches(<span class="cga_opparam">target-selector</span>)</p>
<br>
<p class="code2">bool inside(<span class="cga_opparam">target-selector</span>, <span class="cga_opparam">label</span>)</p>
<p class="code2">bool overlaps(<span class="cga_opparam">target-selector</span>, <span class="cga_opparam">label</span>)</p>
<p class="code2">bool touches(<span class="cga_opparam">target-selector</span>, <span class="cga_opparam">label</span>)</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<ul>
	<li><span class="cga_opparam">target-selector</span> (keyword)<br>
	Target selector for the query:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="codelight">intra</span>: Checks against occluder shapes in the same shape tree (i.e. from the same inital shape).</li>
		<li><span class="codelight">inter</span>: Checks against occluder shapes in other shape trees (i.e. generated by other initial shapes in the neighborhood).</li>
		<li><span class="codelight">all</span>: Checks both <span class="codelight">intra</span> and <span class="codelight">inter</span>.</li>
	</ul>
	If no selector is given, <span class="codelight">all</span> is used.</li>
	<li><span class="cga_opparam">label</span> (string)<br>
	Given a label identifier the occlusion query is performed only on occluder shapes that match the requested <a href="op_label.html">label</a>. An empty label will behave as an unlabeled occlusion query.</li>
</ul>
		
<h2>Returns</h2>

<p><span class="cga_keyword">true</span> if the geometry of the current shape lies fully inside, overlaps, or touches the <em>closed</em> geometry of another shape respectively, otherwise <span class="cga_keyword">false</span>.</p>

<p class="info">
An occlusion query tests for intersections between shapes. There are three different boolean functions available to examine the spatial context of the geometry of the current shape:
<ul>
	<li><span class="code_std">inside()</span> returns <span class="cga_keyword">true</span> if the geometry of the current shape lies <em>completely inside</em> or <em>completely on the surface</em> of one of the closed geometries specified by <span class="cga_opparam">target-selector</span> and <span class="cga_opparam">label</span>.</li>
	<li><span class="code_std">overlaps()</span> returns <span class="cga_keyword">true</span> if the geometry of the current shape lies <em>partly or completely inside</em> of one of the closed geometries specified by <span class="cga_opparam">target-selector</span> and <span class="cga_opparam">label</span> (or vice-versa).</li>
	<li><span class="code_std">touches()</span> returns <span class="cga_keyword">true</span> if the geometry of the current shape <em>overlaps</em> or has a <em>planar contact</em> with one of the closed geometries specified by <span class="cga_opparam">target-selector</span> and <span class="cga_opparam">label</span>.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Unlabeled occlusion queries</h3>

<a name="nolabel"></a>
<p>In case no <span class="cga_opparam">label</span> is given or the <span class="cga_opparam">label</span> is empty, the geometry of the current shape is tested against a practical selection of closed occluder geometries that are automatically generated with the ruleset:
<ul>
	<li>Leaf shapes.</li>
	<li>Shapes on which a <a href="op_comp.html">component split</a> or <a href="op_offset.html">offset</a> has been applied. These operations represent typically the transition from mass to surface. Furthermore, these operations are typically applied on simple geometries which can be tested efficiently against occlusion.</li>
	<li>Any <a href="op_label.html">labeled</a> occluder shape.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Intra occlusion</h3>

<p>Intra occlusion queries are only performed against geometries that are neither a parent/ancestor nor a child/descendant of the query shape since they most likely occlude the current shape due to the top-down grammar modeling approach.</li>

Note that each occlusion query does not consider predecessor occluder shapes, namely the component split volume that a Tile originates from.

The <span class="cga_keyword">inside()</span> query prevents the insertion of tiles that are not visible because they are occluded by neighboring blocks or roofs. The <span class="cga_keyword">touches()</span> query prevents the creation of windows that occlude neighboring blocks or roofs and inserts a wall instead.</em></td>

<h3>Concrete example</h3>

Let us look at a concrete example. The picture below shows a building model. First the rule generates an U-shaped mass model by using the subdivision split operation. As a consequence, the geometries of the side wings touch the geometry of the main block and unrealistically intersected windows are generated. 
<p class="piccaptioncentered"><img src="images/occlusion-modern-building.png">
<br>
Left: No occlusion queries are used. Center: Occluded windows are colored red. Right: Occluded windows are dropped.</p>
<p>The rule which constructs the windows looks like this:
<pre class="code3">
WindowOpening --> Sill s('1,'1,windowSetback) t(0,0,'-1) [ i(openbox) Wall ] Window
</pre></p>
<p>The rule first invokes the generation of a window sill, then sets the size of the scope to the depth of the window setback and translates the scope accordingly. Afterwards the openbox asset is inserted to model the wall on the side of the window opening. Finally the actual Window generation is invoked.</p>
<p>To make this rule react to occlusions, we add a <span class="cga_keyword">touches()</span> condition:
<pre class="code3">
WindowOpening-->
  case touches(intra) : Wall
  else : Sill s('1,'1,windowSetback) t(0,0,'-1) [ i(openbox) Wall ] Window
</pre></p>
<p>Now, in case the geometry of the WindowOpening shape, which is a rectangular polygon generated by the typical facade split rules, touches another shape's geometry, the rule just invokes the Wall rule and does not create a window. Otherwise the rule is applied as before. The above figure shows the resulting building model on the right.</p>
