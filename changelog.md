# CITYENGINE SDK 3.2.10650 CHANGELOG

This section lists changes compared to CityEngine SDK 3.2.10352.

## General Info
* CityEngine SDK 3.2.10650 is used in CityEngine 2024.1.10650.

## PRT API
* `prt::Attributable::toXML()`: fixed a bug where some float numbers were converted to wrong string values in rare cases. Further, the maximum number of digits in the string representation was reduced by 1.  

## PRTX API
* `prtx::EncodePreparator`: fixed a bug in merge-by-material setups where vertex normals for faces with holes were wrong when meshes with vertex nomals were merged with meshes without vertex normals. 

## CGA
* New features:
  * inline keyword: Allows to immediately generate a rule and continue working on the resulting shape(s). This means any rule can be used like a builtin shape operation.
  * union, subtract, intersect keywords: added Boolean 3D operations.
  * extrude operation: Added support to extrude edges.
* New operations:
  * tag operation
* Changes to existing features:
  * i operation: The new parameter cleanupMode allows for disabling the numerical geometry cleanup for inserted asset. This improves the support for assets with tiny details.
  * cleanupGeometry operation: Removing coplanar edges now preserves the first edge.
  * Floating point precision:
      * All internal geometry processing was switched form float to double precision. The numerical behaviour is more accurate now. It is possible that some rules change behaviour because e.g a float value comparison gives a different result now.
      * Float to string conversion (e.g. str() function and print() operation): fixed wrong string values in rare cases. Further, the maximum number of digits in the string representation was reduced by 1.

## Built-In Codecs
* ShapeBuffer Encoder:
   * Disabled vertex / normal / uv merging. This preserves small geometric details and improves performance.
* USD Decoder:
   * Fixed a race condition which led to decode failures if multiple assets with the same ResolveMap key were decoded at the same time.  


# CITYENGINE SDK 3.2.10352 CHANGELOG

This section lists changes compared to CityEngine SDK 3.2.10211.

## General Info
* The focus of this release is to fix some issues which are important for certain client applications such as ArcGIS Pro. There is no CityEngine version using this version of the SDK.

## PRT API
* `prt::RuleFileInfo`: fixed wrong rule parameter names (i.e., `prt::RuleFileInfo::Parameter::getName()` and `prt::RuleFileInfo::toXML()`).

## PRTX API
* No changes.

## CGA
* New operations:
  * copyUV operation
* New functions:
  * geometry.hasUVs function

## Built-In Codecs

  * Updated to ODA 25.6 library.
* IFC Decoder:
  * Added support for exotic versions (like 4x1 and 4x2).
* Shapebuffer Decoder:
  * Fixed a crash when faces had less than 3 vertices. Such faces are ignored now.
  * Fixed a bug where the first edge of triangle fans and strips was wrong.
* OBJ and GLTF Encoders:
  * Non-ASCII characters are supported now. Previously these were replaced by '_'.
  * No '_0' suffix is added to the filename anymore if the "memory budget" option is disabled.
* DAE, FBX and VOB Encoders:
  * No '_0' suffix is added to the filename anymore if the "memory budget" option is disabled.
* USD Decoder:
  * Fixed a bug where duplicate materials were created (instead of one shared material).
  * Fixed a bug where Material attribute overrides in USD meshes were ignored by the importer in some cases. 

## Misc Changes and Fixes
* Applied security updates for libxml (2.13.3) and giflib (5.2.2).


# CITYENGINE SDK 3.2.10211 CHANGELOG

This section lists changes compared to CityEngine SDK 3.2.9903.

## General Info
* CityEngine SDK 3.2.10211 is used in CityEngine 2024.0.10211.

## PRT API
* `prt::Object::toXML()` (including all subclasses): fixed dependency on system locale and improved performance.

## PRTX API
* `prtx::EncodePreparator::PreparationFlags::processHoles`: improved the case `prtx::HoleProcessor::TRIANGULATE_FACES_WITH_HOLES`. Before, it was possible that tiny gaps in the connectivity were created. Now the mesh stays watertight. However, in some cases there might be faces with more than 3 vertices now. 
* `prtx::MaterialBuilder::setString()`: fixed a rare crash when setting the shader.

## CGA
* New features:
    * A Visual CGA Design (*.vcga) can now be imported. You can call its start rule and override its attributes and extension nodes in the import statement.
    * Default extension implementation forwarding: It is now possible to reuse the default implementation of an extension rule from an imported ruleset in a new extension rule. 
* New annotations:
    * @MaterialFile annotation
* Changes to existing features:
    * setback, setbackToArea, setbackPerEdge, shapeLUO, splitAndSetbackPerimeter operations: Collinear vertices are now kept on the resulting setback edges. The setback edges will now match the initial edges.
    * convexify operation:
      * The topology of the input geometry is maintained and the resulting convex polygons are fully connected now. Note: The individual convex polygons (typically created via a subsequent component split) can contain collinear vertices now. These can be removed using the cleanupGeometry operation.
      * Existing component tags are preserved now.
    * geometry.isConcave function and general concavity classification: Improved handling of collinear vertices. Collinear vertices are now consistently classified as convex.
    * material.{colormap|...|metallicmap}.rw attribute: changed rotation center from (0.5, 0.5) to (0,0).
* Bugfixes:
    * readStringTable, readFloatTable: Fixed a crash when reading a non-existing table (Linux only).
    * setupProjection operation:
      * Fixed a bug where widthOffset and heightOffset were not correctly considered when a uv scaling was defined for the material (for example material.colormap.su).
      * Fixed a bug where offset values where not considered for projection axes scope.zx.
    * CGA Compiler:
      * Fixed incorrect handling of the @Hidden annotation for import statements. Note: In the UI of older versions of CityEngine or client apps using an older version of CityEngine SDK, hidden imports will not be hidden in RPKs created with CityEngine 2024.0.
      * Fixed a bug where annotations were not assigned to import statements but to subsequent statements.

## Built-In Codecs
* GLTF Encoder:
  * Now correctly converts colors to linear space.
  * Adapted to texture trafo rotation center change from (0.5, 0.5) to (0,0).

# CITYENGINE SDK 3.2.9903 CHANGELOG

This section lists changes compared to CityEngine SDK 3.1.9666.

## General Info
* The focus of this release is to fix some issues which are important for certain client applications such as ArcGIS Pro. There is no CityEngine version using this version of the SDK.
* This release focuses on stability and performance for multi-threaded decode-encode usage of PRT, adds support for calling `prt::init()` multiple times to load additional custom encoders and introduces support for decoding IFC4 files. 

## PRT API
* It is now possible to call `prt::init()` multiple times to load (additional) custom extensions. Before, all extensions had to be loaded on the first call. Also, it is possible now to initialize PRT again after shutdown. PRT is (considered) shutdown when all library handles returned by `prt::init()` have been destroyed.

## PRTX API
* `prtx::DataBackend` has been optimized for performance in a multi-threaded setup. Its internal lock usage is finer-grained now, allowing parallel decodes for multiple assets.

## CGA
* New functions:
  * assetMetadata function.

## Built-In Codecs
* IFC, DWG Decoders, Encoders:
  * Made them thread-safe. Before, only one of these 4 codecs could run at a time - otherwise, PRT would crash.
  * Updated to ODA 24.11 library
* IFC Decoder:
  * Added support for IFC4.
* DWG Encoder:
   * Fixed a bug where the same textures got written multiple times.
* USD Decoder, Encoder:
  * Made them thread-safe. Before, only one of the two could run at a time - otherwise, PRT would crash.  
* FBX Decoder, Encoder:
  * Made them thread-safe. Before, only one of the two could run at a time - otherwise, PRT would crash.
  * The FBX codecs are in a separate shared library now (com.esri.prt.fbx.dll / .so).
  * Updated to FBX 2020.3.4 library.
  * Dropped support for FBX on 32bit.
* GLTF Encoder:
  * Fixed a crash: the encoder now ignores faces with less than 3 vertices.
  * Added support for data URIs with mime type application/gltf-buffer.
  * Updated to fx-gltf 2.0.0 and nlohmann::json 3.11.3 libraries. 
* Vue Encoder:
  * Made it thread-safe.

## Misc Changes and Fixes
* Applied security updates for zlib (1.3.0), libtiff (4.6.0), libxml (2.12.3), boost (1.84).
* Windows: switched to MSVC 14.37.
* Linux: switched to GCC 11 including new libstdc++ ABI (_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1).

# CITYENGINE SDK 3.1.9666 CHANGELOG

This section lists changes compared to CityEngine SDK 3.0.8961.

## General Info
* CityEngine SDK 3.1.9666 is used in CityEngine 2023.1.9666.

## PRT API
* `prt::init()`: Now ensures the current working directory does not change when loading extension libraries.

## PRTX API
* `prtx::Material`, `prtx::MaterialBuilder`: added getters, setters and keys for the new "doubleSided" attribute. The default value is true.
* `prtx::Shape`: 
  * added keys for the new "doubleSided" material attribute.
  * switched `getShapeSymbol()` to in64_t and fixed a shapesymbol collision bug (repeated CGA imports).
* `prtx::LogFormatter`:
  * added new `operator%(const std::vector< uint32_t > &v)`.
  * `log(uint32_t const *array, size_t count)` : switched count from uint32_t to size_t.

## CGA
* New features:
  * With the new auto-tag feature, selected operations automatically apply semantic information to output geometry components:
    * setback, setbackToArea, setbackPerEdge, shapeLUO, splitAndSetbackPerimeter operations: Each output edge is tagged as "setback.front", "setback.side", "setback.back" or "setback.remainder".
    * roofGable, roofHip, roofPyramid, roofRidge, roofShed operations: Each output face is tagged as "roof.bottom", "roof.side", or "roof.top".
    * extrude operation: Each output face is tagged as "extrude.bottom", "extrude.side.inner", "extrude.side.outer", or "extrude.top".
    * envelope operation: Each output face is tagged as "envelope.bottom", "envelope.side.base", "envelope.side.slope", "envelope.side.inner", or "envelope.top".
    * taper operation: Each output face is tagged as "taper.bottom" or "taper.side".
  
    The component tags can be queried with the new isTagged selector in the comp, setback, setbackToArea, setbackPerEdge operations and the comp function. 

* New operations:
  * deleteTags operation
  * setTagsFromEdgeAttrs operation
* New functions:
  * geometry.hasTags function
  * geometry.tags function
* New attributes:
  * material.doubleSided attribute
* Changes to existing features:
  * comp, setback, setbackToArea, setbackPerEdge operations, comp function:
        Existing selectors can be combined in logical selector expressions (e.g. left || right).
        User-defined functions and all built-in functions can be used in logical selector expressions.
        Added new isTagged selector.
* Bugfixes:
  * comp operation: Fixed a bug where using the combine operator (=) created a new shape even when no components were selected.

## Built-In Codecs
* Collada Decoder:
  * Now detects if a Collada file has been written by SketchUp with the "two-sided" option enabled. In this case, the decoder will set the "doubleSided" material attribute to false. 
  * Made the decoder more robust against invalid Collada tags.
* USD Decoder:
  * The USD importer has been improved to accept resolve map keys for textures which represent absolute and relative paths.
* USD Encoder:
  * The USD exporter now uses separate indices for all vertex attributes. This allows for "watertight" meshes with hard edges (i.e. a shared point but different vertex normals). 
  *	The USD exporter has been improved to pass validation checks for default prims, stage up-axis and material binding API.
* GLTF Decoder & Encoder:
  * The glTF material attribute "doubleSided" is now handled both by the exporter and importer. It is translated to and from the CGA material attribute of same name.   
* Unreal Encoder:
  * Does not change the curent working directory anymore when being loaded in `prt:init()`.

# CITYENGINE SDK 3.0.8961 CHANGELOG

This section lists changes compared to CityEngine SDK 3.0.8905.

## General Info
* The focus of this release is to fix some issues which are important for certain client applications such as ArcGIS Pro. There is no CityEngine version using this version of the SDK.
* This release contains various improvements in performance and memory usage.

## PRT API
* Improved the error reporting of `prt::createRuleFileInfo` for CGBs compiled by a more recent version of CityEngine.

## PRTX API
* `prtx::MeshBuilder` has been optimized for performance.

## CGA
* `scatter` operation on volumes and `inside`, `overlaps`, `touches` functions: Holes in triangle faces were ignored, leading to wrong results. That is fixed now.

## Built-In Codecs
* OBJ Decoder:
  * Added a fallback heuristic to look for MTL files in the same directory as the OBJ, if the specified MTL path is incorrect.
* IFC Encoder:
  * Enable concurrent encoding of IFC assets by ensuring unique temporary file names.
* FBX Decoder:
  * Added support for FBX assets with upper case (.FBX) extension.
* glTF Decoder:
  * To save memory, we stop copying texture coordinates on UV set 0 to higher UV sets and rely on the "fallback to UV set 0" mechanism instead (see "Texturing: Essential knowledge" in the CGA documentation).
* glTF Encoder:
  * Improved how the material blend mode is set by analyzing the opacitymap pixel distribution.
* Collada Decoder:
  * Fixed a numerical imprecision in material opacity computation based on luminance.
  * Fixed an intermittent decoding failure with empty `<source_data>` and `<copyright>` tags.
  * Made the decoder more robust against invalid Collada tags.
* Collada Encoder:
  * Fixed a bug which prevented the encoder option "globalScalingFactor" to be actually set to 0 (and write the `<unit>` tag).
* USD Decoder:
  * Fixed the handling of texture paths with white spaces and/or UNC syntax.

## Misc Changes and Fixes
* Improved code examples in the PRT "Architecture" pdf.
* Applied security updates for libtiff (4.5.1) and libxml (2.10.4).

# CITYENGINE SDK 3.0.8905 CHANGELOG

This section lists changes compared to CityEngine SDK 2.7.8603.

## General Info
* CityEngine SDK 3.0.8905 is used in CityEngine 2023.0.8905.
* **Client applications must update their code** to find the cgb in a rule package, see details below. It is easy though!  
* The CGA Compiler was upgraded to a new major version 2.0. This leads to significant changes: 
  * New rpks might contain more than one cgb file. Only one of them can be used, and a new function has been introduced to find this main cgb. See `prt::ResolveMap:findCGBKey()` below. The old way of iterating over all keys to find the first cgb does not work anymore since there can now be inner cgbs which must not be used. This is a breaking change - you must adapt your client code! And it is actually much more convenient to use this function, so the change is trivial.
  * Rule packages (rpks) created with CityEngine 2023.0 are not compatible with older versions of the CityEngine SDK. For minor version updates of the compiler, forward compatibility (i.e. old PRT, new rpk) is done in a best-effort manner (means: the rpk will work if no new feature of CGA is used). For major version updates this is not the case, an old PRT will refuse to use newer rpks.
  
## PRT API
* New function `prt::ResolveMap:findCGBKey()`: This function **must** be used now to find the main cgb file key in the `ResolveMap` from an rpk. 
* New function `prt::ResolveMap:findCGBKeys()`: This function is designed for advanced use cases where the `ResolveMap` is manged by the client application and can contain more than one main cgb.
* `prt::createRuleFileInfo()`: the error handling of faulty cgb files got improved. It returns a `RuleFileInfo` also for cgb files with unexpected errors. Before, a nullptr was returned in some cases. Note that `prt::generate()` will still fail on buggy cgb files.  

## PRTX API
* `prtx::GeometryBuilder::GeometryBuilder(const prtx::Geometry& geometry)`: improved robustness (does not crash anymore on geometries created with `prtx::DebugUtils::toGeometry()`)
* Windows: `prtx::FileSystemAdaptor::createStream()`: support for paths with length >= 260 characters.
* Fixed a bug in `prtx::EncodePreparator` where collecting CGA reports led to a cycle, resulting in consumption of all memory. 

## CGA
* New features:
  * The new dynamic import feature allows to import and initialize a ruleset at the time of rule invocation. Overrides can be configured with at-runtime evaluated values.
* New Annotations:
  * @DisplayName annotation.
* Changes to existing features:
  * offset operation: Changed the topology of the resulting offset geometry for each face: At the boundary of border faces no duplicate vertices are created anymore. 
* Bugfixes:
  * setback, setbackPerEdge, setbackToArea operations:
    * Fixed wrong modulo wrapping of large negative index selectors.
    * Selectors bottom, top, object.bottom, object.top, world.down, world.up and world.side now work as expected. 
  * Added support for reading assets and textures that are located at long (>= 260 chars) absolute paths in the filesystem (Windows only). 

## Built-In Codecs
* Unreal Encoder:
  * Updated to Datasmith 5.1.0 library. Note that Datasmith 5.X files can not be read in Datasmith 4.X based applications. Use Unreal 5.0+ or Twinmotion 2023.1+. 
* USD Encoder:
  * Added support for all uv sets and texture layers specified in UsdPreviewSurface (before, only uvs 0 and the colormap were exported)
  * Added fallback to dirtmap if there is no colormap.
  * Fixed a crash in reports collection (see the fix in `prtx::EncodePreparator` above).
  * Windows: Fixed crash if a too long filename was used.
  * Fixed a bug where single-channel grey8 textures were not applied in materials.
* USD Decoder:
  * Added support for string-valued UsdPrimvarReader varnames (fixes Apple's USDZ sample assets where uvs / textures were missing).
  * Added support for 'varying' uv interpolation scheme.
  * Now reads uvs also if no texture is set.
  * Improved performance for reading from non-file URIs.
  * Improved robustness when reading invalid USD files (e.g. fixed a crash if invalid face indices were encountered in the USD file.)
* VOB Encoder:
  * Fixed a bug which could lead to a crash on exit.  
* OBJ Encoder:
  * Fixed a bug which could lead to a crash on exit.  
* Collada Encoder:
  * Fixed a bug which could lead to a crash on exit.  
* CityEngine 3WS WebScene Encoder:
  * This encoder got removed. The CityEngine Web Viewer is not available anymore, it is succeeded by the [ArcGIS Scene Viewer](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webscene/viewer.html). Use the SLPK encoder to export and publish your models for ArcGIS Scene Viewer.  

## Misc Changes and Fixes
* Windows: 3rd party symbols are now hidden in com.esri.prt.codecs.dll. 
* `prtx::ExtensionManger`: Clarified log messages if loading an extension fails. The warning message saying that the extension could not be loaded was dominated by underlying details which were logged as errors. These details are now logged on debug level.

# CITYENGINE SDK 2.7.8603 CHANGELOG

This section lists changes compared to CityEngine SDK 2.7.8538.

## General Info
* The focus of this release is to fix some issues which are important for certain client applications such as ArcGIS Pro. There is no CityEngine version using this version of the SDK.

## PRT API
* No changes.

## PRTX API
* No changes.

## CGA
* No changes.

## Built-In Codecs
* USD Decoder
  * Ensure that all associated files of an USD asset are read through the `prtx::DataBackend` and can therefore make use of the PRT caching system.
  * Fixed two bugs that prevented decoding of USD assets from general URIs.

## Misc Changes and Fixes
* Reduced peak memory usage when loading assets (e.g. when using the CGA `i` operation).
* Updated 3rd-party libraries to fix security vulnerabilities:
  * zlib 1.2.13
  * libtiff 4.5.0
  * libxml2 2.10.3

# CITYENGINE SDK 2.7.8538 CHANGELOG

This section lists changes compared to CityEngine SDK 2.6.8300.

## General Info
* CityEngine SDK 2.7.8538 is used in CityEngine 2022.1.8538.

## PRT API
* `prt::generate()`: fixed a (rare) crash on Linux.

## PRTX API
* `prtx::EncodePreparator`: added `PrepartionFlags::meshMerging()` function and `MeshMerging::Action` enum. `ALL_OF_SAME_MATERIAL_AND_TYPE` corresponds to the old `mergeByMaterial()` flag; `ALL_OF_SAME_TYPE` is new functionality and allows for merging meshes with various materials into one mesh.  
* `prtx::EncodePreparator`: deprecated `mergeByMaterial()` 

## CGA
* New operations:
  * splitAndSetbackPerimeter operation.
* Bugfixes:
  * offset operation: Fixed wrong geometry in case the inside selector was used but no inside faces were created due to a too large (negative) offset. Now the original geometry is kept in such cases.
  * deleteHoles operation: Fixed wrong geometry when deleting holes in non-planar shapes.
  * comp operation: Fixed wrong geometry when selecting face components with non-planar holes.
  * split operation: Fixed warnings containing the wrong operation name.

## Built-In Codecs Changes and Fixes
* Added Decoder for Esri's lerc image format (com.esri.prt.codecs.LercDecoder).
* USD Codecs:
  * The 3rd-party libraries (usd_ms.dll and tbb.dll) are now prefixed with 'prt_' in order to prevent clashes if these libraries are already present in a host app (e.g. Autodesk Maya) with incompatible versions.
* USD Encoder:
  * Now writes the initial shape attributes (e.g. start rule, random seed, OID) to the corresponding USD nodes.
  * Now writes the CGA report values to the corresponding USD component nodes.
  * Now uses the `prt::Callbacks` interface to write the encoded files instead of directly writing to disk.
  * Added mesh merging option to control whether all meshes of one shape (for example a building) should be merged by material or into one single mesh (option `meshMerging`, values `perInitialShapeByMaterial` (default) and `perInitialShape`).
  * Fixed a bug which led to a crash if Windows network shares were used in a path via UNC (Universal Naming Convention).
* USD Decoder:
  * Fixed a crash if a usdz file was encountered in a rpk.
* GLTF Encoder:
  * Fixed a bug where multiple redundant occlusion/roughness/metallic maps were created.
  * Now avoids re-encoding of occlusion/roughness/metallic maps if possible.
* Unreal Encoder:
  * Does not combine (and thus re-encode) roughness/metallic maps anymore.

## Misc Changes and Fixes
* Performance optimizations to speed up `prt::generate()` for rules with many attributes and consts.

# CITYENGINE SDK 2.6.8300 CHANGELOG

This section lists changes compared to CityEngine SDK 2.6.8135.

## General Info
* CityEngine SDK 2.6.8300 is used in CityEngine 2022.0.8300.

## PRT API
* Fixed `prt::FileLogHandler` to correctly handle non-ascii characters instead of crashing.
* Fixed a crash in `prt::CacheObject::CACHE_TYPE_NONREDUNDANT` cache implementation (after flushing).

## PRTX API
* `prtx::ExtensionManager`: Improved warning if a library cannot be loaded (added path to core library).

## CGA
* New features:
  * Rules with start keyword can be invoked with the start identifier.
  * Rules with extension keyword can be redefined in an import statement.
* Changes to existing features:
    * resetMaterial operation: Added an overload which allows for resetting the material of the geometry.
* Bugfixes:
    * readMaterial function: Fixed empty maps (empty string means "no texture").
    * alignScopeToGeometry operation: Fixed crash when faceSelector was set to largest. This happened when the current geometry had zero area.

## Built-In Codecs Changes and Fixes
* Unreal Encoder:
  * Fixed bugs where multiple terrains did not align.
  * Improved landscape material border handling.
  * Fixed a bug which led to undefined behaviour when mixing non-textured and textured geometry.
  * Corrected normal map amount & opacity for Base Materials / Twinmotion.
* GLTF Decoder:
  * Bugfix: Read uvs also if no texture defined in the material.
  * Bugfix: Avoid setting the material's texture trafo attributes (to the default) even if not used.
* CGAMat Decoder:
  * Fixed empty texture maps (empty string means "no texture").
* USD Codecs:
  * Fixed deadlock on startup.
  * Fixed tbb dependency loading on Linux to find library in the same folder.
* USD Decoder:
  * Implemented a "best effort" approach for reading partly unknown assets instead of just failing. This includes empty mesh nodes with non-empty child mesh nodes, assets with unknown materials or shaders, and assets with both point instances and other geometries.
  * Fixed a crash on materials which did not have a shader id attribute.
* OBJ Decoder:
  * Improved performance.
  * MTL decoder: Fixed a number reading issue on some localized systems.
* IFC Decoder:

# CITYENGINE SDK 2.6.8135 CHANGELOG

This section lists changes compared to CityEngine SDK 2.5.7799.

## General Info
* The focus of this release is to fix some issues which are important for certain client applications such as plugins. There is no CityEngine version using this version of the SDK.

## PRTX API
* Fixed `prtx::ResolveMap::anchorRelativeKey` for the "key = URI" case if the anchored key contains characters that need to be percent encoded. Note that the signature changed (new `ResolveMap` argument).
* Fixed `prtx::URI::replaceExtension()` to use the correct string encoding when percent encoding.
* Improved `prtx::EncodePreparator` to keep the numerical precision of meshes which are far away (>10'000 m) from the initial shape's orgin. However, such meshes won't be merged to one mesh anymore if "merge by material" is enabled. 
* Fixed a crash in `prtx::Material::getBlindData()` if an illegal key was used.
* Fixed documentation of the texture trafo (XXXmapTrafo) keys of `prtx::Material`.

## CGA
* Changes to existing features:
  * setback, setbackToArea, setbackPerEdge, shapeLUO operation: Setback faces are now more likely to attach to neighboring edges at convex vertices. This avoids gaps in presence of altering setback distances. If the setback face cannot be attached to an edge the respective side is cut inwards in order to avoid spikes.
  * i operation: Assets with very large coordinates (> 10'000) are now handled differently on insert and export. This greatly improves numerical precision. However, such assets are not considered instanced anymore.

* Bugfixes:

# CITYENGINE SDK 2.4.7316 CHANGELOG

This section lists changes compared to CityEngine SDK 2.3.6821.

## General Info

* CityEngine SDK 2.4.7316 is used in CityEngine 2021.0.7316.
* MacOS is not supported anymore.

## PRT API

* We added functionality for dealing with **embedded resources** in general and specifically in geometry files. Modern 3D formats like glb or usdz allow for embedding all referenced data (e.g. textures) into one file. First, support for using such files in a PRT client application has been simplified (e.g., when building a ResolveMap with the ResolveMapBuilder). Second, tools for writing extensions (i.e. GeometryDecoders) which can handle embedded resources have been added to the API.

* `EncoderInfo`:
  * added `getExtensions()` function.
  * added `getMerit()` function.
  * added `getType()` function.
* `DecoderInfo`:
  * added `canHandleEmbeddedResources()` function.
  * added `getMerit()` function.
  * added `getType()` function.
* `ResolveMapBuilder`: `addEntry()` function: an optional parameter was added to control embedded resources handling (`EmbeddedEntriesMode` enum). By default, to-be-added entries are now inspected if they contain embeded resources, and these are automatically added to the `ResolveMap`. This was not the case before.
* `ResolveMap`: `getString()`: Bugfix: `stat` was not set to `STATUS_OK` if the call succeeded.
* `createResolveMap()`:
  * This also works for content types with embedded resorces (such as glb) which was not documented before.
  * Bugfix: unpacking to file system did not work for types with embedded resources.
* `Status`: new status code `STATUS_FILE_READ_FAILED`
* `FileOutputCallbacks`: Bugfix: the class did not correctly handle Unicode (UTF-16) paths on windows.
* `InitialShapeBuilder`: `setAttributes()` function: added documentation about how to set up 2D array CGA attributes.
* architecture.pdf: fixed wrong function names in "Extension Lifetime" section.

## PRTX API

* A general note for decoder implementors about how to deal with embedded resources: Typically, a `Decoder` for a format which supports embedded resources needs a matching `ResolveMapProvider` implementation which scans the resource and creates a `ResolveMap` with the embedded entries. Each entry maps a "human readable" key to a "complex" `URI` with the format in the scheme part. In order to decode such an URI (i.e. extracting the raw data the URI is referring to), a matching `StreamAdaptor` needs to be implemented and registered. Let's take the GLTFDecoder as example:
  * The GLTFDecoder decodes the actual format into a `Geometry`,
  * the GLTFResolveMapProvider creates the `ResolveMap` which contains embedded textures as entries with a key created with `ResolveMap::anchorEmbeddedKey()` and an URI having the "gltf" scheme, and
  * the GLTFAdaptor uses the "gltf" scheme URIs to extract the binary data of the embedded items.
* `DecoderFactory`: added optional `canHandleER` parameter to constructor. If this parameter is set to true, the Decoder can handle embedded resources and a matching `ResolveMapProvider` and `StreamAdaptor` must be registered.  
* `ResolveMap`:
  * added `anchorEmbeddedKey()` function.
  * added `anchorRelativeKey()` function.
  * deprecated `replaceLastKeySegment()` function (use `anchorRelativeKey()` instead).
* `URI`: added `DELIM_FRAGMENT` and `DELIM_QUERY` constants.
* `URIUtils`
  * `createCompositeURI()`:
    * replaced the two function overloads with one function with default values.
    * Bugfix: it did not work for >2 nesting levels.
  * `addFragment()`: Bugfix: in some cases, an empty host componet was unexpectedly added to the URI.
* `EncoderInfoBuilder`: added `setMerit()` function.
* `FileExtension`: Bugfix: fixed a rare crash in copy constructor / destructor.
* `Shape`: added documentation about how to extract the number of rows for 2D CGA array attributes.

## CGA

* New features:
  * Local variables can be defined using the with keyword.
  * Support for reading DWG assets.
* New operations:
  * setMaterial operation.
  * resetMaterial operation.
  * roofRidge operation.
  * alignScopeToGeometryBBox operation.
  * footprint operation.
* New functions:
  * getMaterial function.
  * sum function.
  * listToArray, listFromArray functions.
  * geometry.groups function.
  * geometry.materials function.
  * filesSearch function: In contrast to fileSearch this function returns an array of strings instead of a stringlist.
  * assetNamingInfos function: In contrast to assetNamingInfo this function returns an array of strings instead of a stringlist.
* Changes to existing features:
  * i operation and initial shapes: Improved automatic removal of 0-area faces, 0-length edges and 0-angles. The cleanup is less invasive now.
  * roofShed operation: Negative angles are now supported. Note that face and vertex indices of a shed roof are different now.
  * USD reader: added support for USDZ files.
  * convert function: Added a version which takes the coordinate values as array.
  * assetsSortSize, assetsSortRatio, imagesSortRatio functions: Added versions which take the list of files as array of strings instead of a stringlist.
  * imageBestRatio, imageApproxRatio, assetBestSize, assetApproxSize, assetFitSize, assetBestRatio, assetApproxRatio functions: An invalid string selector does not fall back to a default value but now leads to a runtime error.
  * ceil, floor, rint, isinf, isnan, isNull functions: Support for arrays.
  * comp, offset, extrude, roofHip, roofGable, roofPyramid, roofShed, taper, split, setback, setbackPerEdge, setbackToArea, shapeLUO, innerRectangle, convexify operations: Asset groups are now kept.
  * extrude, taper, setback, setbackPerEdge, setbackToArea, shapeLUO, innerRectangle, convexify operations: Asset face materials are now kept.
  * comp(v) operation: The material of vertex components is now set to default.
* Bugfixes:
  * offset operation: In case of a failure a crash is prevented or a resulting degenerated geometry is avoided. This happened in rare cases with positive offset distance and collinear vertices.
  * geometry.angle function: Fixed wrong azimuth. It was incorrectly shifted by 180 degrees.
  * Fixed an issue where the group name of the geometry was not set to initialShape.name for initial shapes with 1 face.
  * setback, setbackToArea, setbackPerEdge operation: Avoid creating an unnecessary edge for O-shaped setback geometry.
  * roofHip, roofGable, roofPyramid, roofShed operations: Fixed a bug which led to a wrong geometry or a wrong scope in rare cases on shapes with holes.
  * roofShed operation:
    * Fixed incorrect consideration of negative indexes.
    * Fixed a bug that led to self-intersected roofs on concave faces.
  * taper operation: Fixed a wrongly aligned geometry on non-planar shapes with holes.
  * splitString function: A split of an empty string now returns [""] instead of an empty array.
  * fileSearch function: If no matching files are found the function now returns an empty string "" which is the correct representation of an empty string list. Before a string ";" was returned which corresponds to a string list with one empty string element.
  * isinf function: Fixed a bug for values that are not a number: isinf(ln(-1)) wrongly returned true, now returns false.

## Built-In Codecs Changes and Fixes

* Added Decoder and Encoder for Autodesk's DWG format (com.esri.prt.codecs.DWGDecoder, com.esri.prt.codecs.DWGEncoder).
* Removed Encoder for Pixar's RenderMan format.
* USD Encoder & Decoders:
  * Added support for USDZ in both the USD decoder and encoder.
  * Updated to USD 21.02 library.
  * Decoder: Bugfix: Sometimes, temporary files were still locked after usage.
* SLPK Encoder:
  * The node hierarchy and texture resolutions got optimized for improved rendering performance in the ArcGIS Online Scene Viewer.
  * The geometry LODs are more fine-grained now, resulting in a smoother viewing experience in the ArcGIS Online Scene Viewer.
* Unreal Encoder:
  * Updated to Datasmith 4.26 library.
  * Support for exporting multiple (CityEngine) scenarios in one export session.
  * Support for multiple UV sets.
  * Changed PBR textures export from srgb to linear color space and removed obsolete color space conversion shader.
  * Bugfix: Texture modes are now correctly set if the same texture is exported both as normalmap and diffusemap. Before such textures were exported as normalmaps only.
* GLTFDecoder:
  * Changed embedded resources URI handling from fragments to the "gltf" scheme. Note that legacy URIs encountered in old rpks are converted automatically during the `ResolveMap` extraction from the rpk.
  * Does not abort anymore if GLTF extension "KHR_materials_SpecularGlossiness" is encountered. It now just reads the geometry and supported material parts.
  * Improved data URI handling.
  * Bugfix: Percent encode texture key for URI fallback handling.
* GLTFEncoder:
  * Deactivated merging for vertices/uvs/normals. This might give small differencies in coordinates/normals/uvs and tiny faces are not removed anymore.
* VUE Encoder:
  * Moved VUE encoder to a separate PRT extension library (so it can be loaded independently).
  * Updated to VueExport 15.0.0.0 library.
* ShapeBufferDecoder:
  * Support ".multipatch" extension.
  * Fixed invalid embedded texture URIs. Embedded textures now use "shp" scheme instead of a temporary memory URI. The URIs are therefore valid as long as the passed-in mutipatch buffer is valid.
* Unreal, SLPK Encoders: Bugfix: Avoid upscaling textures in atlas generation.
* Alembic Encoder: Updated to Alembic 1.7.16 and OpenEXR 2.5.2 libraries.
* FBX Encoder: Updated to fbxsdk 2020.2.
* All geometry Encoders:
  * Select encoder based on texture extension, not the pixelformat. This leads to e.g. "builtin:uvtest.png" being actually writen as png, not jpg.

* All image Encoders:
  * Added "existingFiles" option.
  * Throw exception if encode failed, i.e. the whole geometry export is aborted if an image can not be encoded.
* JPGEncoder:
  * In some cases (lossy) re-encoding of images can be avoided and the original file can just be copied. This has been extended to memory URIs and flipped textures.
  * Added "forceJFIFHeaders" option. Default is false. If set to true it is guaranteed that all written files have a JFIF header, even if the original file had an EXIF header and re-encoding was avoided. This option is enabled in the ShapeBufferEncoder.
  * Removed "textureAddAlphaMask" option. That functionality was extracted into the specific JPGAEncoder.
* PNGEncoder, TIFFEncoder: In some cases re-encoding of images can be avoided and the original file can just be copied. This has been extended to memory URIs.
* RAWEncoder, TIFFEncoder: Bugfix: The option "textureBase64" was just ignored.
* All image Decoders: Bugfix: improved error handling when decoding images (in some cases there were duplicate errors & re-reported errors from a different asset).

## Misc Changes and Fixes

* Windows: Switched to Visual Studio 2019, Toolchain 14.27.
* Linux: Switched to GCC 9.3.1.
* Enabled C++17 language standard.
* Updated 3rd party libraries:

    * Fixed a bug that mistakenly returned true in rare situations due to near zero-area triangles.
    * Inter-ccclusion: Fixed a bug that created an occluder shape by a component split or offset operation during the intra ghost tree generation which was then mistakenly considered also for inter occlusion.
    * Fixed behavior in exports.
  * set operation: fixed a bug: trying to set the initialShape.pz attribute resulted in inconsistent behaviour (mismatch with initialShape.pa).
  * alignScopeToAxes, rotateScope, mirrorScope, setPivot, cleanupGeometry, reduceGeometry, convexify, split operations: Correctly consider a non-adjusted scope coming from a split operation.
  * offset operation: Now keeps asset materials and groups.

    assignments ("filled holes rendering bug") on edge cleanup for
    geometries with per-face-materials.
